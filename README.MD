# Tagless final meetup

This repository contains some code examples, modeled after a fictional navigation API, that show
`tagless final` pattern and how to bring it to a REST api using http4s.

## What can be launched to see something in action

- ScalaTests with `sbt test`

- io.asoldino.taglessfinal.api.Main extends App and will create an HTTP REST server listening to port
5000

- The worksheet introduction.sc, just be aware of the fact that some exception may have been purposely
triggered here and there :)

## Feel free to experiment

and enjoy! 

For any code problem or suggestion please fill a github issue so we can make these examples
more helpful for everyone together.
